# Sparse Manifold Regulation Framework

**Adaptive Control of Continuous Representations for Stable Sparsity**

---

## Overview

SMR++ (Sparse Manifold Regulator Plus) treats sparsity as a **dynamical equilibrium** problem, rather than a static penalty.

- Evolves a **continuous manifold** representation.
- Uses **adaptive diffusion** for stability.
- Regulates sparsity with **PI feedback control**.
- Provides **entropy-based diagnostics** for convergence.

## Algorithms Compared

| Method  | Description |
|---------|------------|
| SMR++   | Adaptive PDE + PI-controlled regulation |
| SOFT    | Exponential soft thresholding |
| HARD    | Deterministic hard cutoff |
| NONE    | Diffusion only (baseline) |
